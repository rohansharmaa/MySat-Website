      <p>MySat communicates with the ground station in 2m and 70cm amateur bands. The task of the team at the ground station will be planning communication sessions, sending telecommands to the satellite and receiving and analyzing data received by the MySat team and radio amateurs. The radio amateur community will be a very important element of the MySat ground segment. Thanks to such cooperation, it will be possible to collect much more data.

      <h3>Communication module</h3>
      <p>The communication module, right after the power supply system and on-board computer, is the most important element of every satellite. Its main task is to send telemetry data and experimental results to Earth and receive telecommands. Telecommands allow you to control the behavior of the satellite according to the plan created by the team at the ground station.</p>
      <p>We use a ready-made solution offered by Innovative Solutions In Space BV Downlink, i.e. the frequency at which we can listen to PW-Sat2 is 435.275 MHz. The telemetry frame will be in AX.25 format (G3RUH scrambler, BPSK modulation). By default, we will broadcast at a speed of 1200 bps, with the possibility of switching to 9600 bps. For reception we use FUNCube Dongle Pro + and a desktop application that will upload data to our server.</p>

      <h3>PW-Sat2 ground station</h3>
      <p>The main ground station PW-Sat2 is located in the Main Building of the Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology of the Warsaw University of Technology. On the roof of the Main Building there is a mast equipped with a rotor that allows tracking PW-Sat2 in orbit.</p>
      <p>The ground station is equipped with an ICOM IC-910 transceiver (for upward communication) and SDR (for receiving data from PW-Sat2) FUNCube Dongle Pro + and two Yagi cross antennas for 2m and 70cm bands. The ground station can be operated remotely, however, for security reasons, there will always be at least one operator with appropriate permissions at the ground station.A spare ground station is located in Gliwice on the roof of the Future Processing building . Thanks to this station, a failure, unexpected interference, or a sudden change in weather will not affect the PW-Sat2 mission.</p>
